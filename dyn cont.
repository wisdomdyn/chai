### 1. **Explore Open Issues**
   - Start by reviewing the GitHub **Issues** tab to see if any bugs are already reported. If they are, try to reproduce the problem by following the steps listed.
   - Sort by labels like "bug" or "help wanted," which might highlight issues ready for debugging.

### 2. **Run the Program and Test Common Use Cases**
   - **Installation**: Install the package manager on different operating systems if possible, and look for errors during setup.
   - **Basic Commands**: Run all documented commands to see if they behave as expected.
   - **Edge Cases**: Test commands with extreme or unexpected input (e.g., very large values, empty inputs, special characters) to see if any bugs surface.

### 3. **Read through the Code**
   - If you know specific files or functions related to reported issues, review the code to understand potential problem areas.
   - Look for functions without error handling, places where data could be undefined or null, and any complex logic that might fail under certain conditions.

### 4. **Enable Debugging and Logging**
   - Most CLI tools have a debug mode or verbose logging. If Chai has these options, enable them to get more information about any errors.
   - If not, consider adding temporary `console.log` or `print` statements in the code to track variable values and workflow progress.

### 5. **Add or Run Tests**
   - Check if there are unit or integration tests in the project. If there are, run them locally using the project's test commands.
   - Write new tests for untested or lightly tested areas, especially edge cases. If any tests fail, they may reveal bugs.

### 6. **Use Static Code Analysis Tools**
   - Tools like **ESLint** for JavaScript or **Prettier** for code formatting can help identify syntax errors and code smells.
   - Additionally, use **Linters** and **Code Analyzers** compatible with the project's programming language to catch bugs early.

Testing and digging into edge cases systematically can quickly reveal issues in most projects. Let me know if you'd like to go deeper into any specific testing approach!
